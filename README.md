List of my own curiosities

## Motivation

During the day, I often have some questions like "how does that work?" or "how does it do X?".

This repository serves as a notebook to keep track of them.

## How do I use this?

Wel, I tend to keep things simple so here how I plan to use this repo:

- I use an Issue for each question or topic I have in mind.
- I will update my findings into the Issues' comments.
- Once I see that I'm done with it, I compile into a Markdown file.

That's it!
